    Time Complexity O(N): Vertices + Edges

    Space Complexity O(N): Vertices + Edges

    The Algorithm:
        starts at a given start cell and spreads out to not visited neighboring cells marking their distance from the start cell
        these neighbor cells repeat the process until the end of the maze is found then the algorithm
        travels back the shortest path to the start end stores it's path

    Args:
        maze:   maze object which will be used to store the generated maze.
        start_pos: position in the maze where to start the pathfinding from
        animate: animate the generating process, False or FPS as integer value.

    Returns:
        the shortest path from start_position the the maze end in the form of a list with grid positions
        example: [(1,1),(2,1),...(5,5)]
